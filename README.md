# MasterThesis
#This repository summarizes part of my master studies at Federal University of ABC (UFABC), Brazil. 
#As I get ready archives and files which I consider relevant in this project, I'll make it available on my portfolio on github.
#This project along with subjects and support from my tutors at the University turned out my interest in programming and particularly in Python and data science.
#Motivated by that, I am now studying and improving my data skills in order to promote a carrer change into data science field, including R language and Python mainly.
